# -Animal-Ageing-and-Longevity

The idea of this notebook is to understand Animal data from 'AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity' (url:'http://genomics.senescence.info/species/') and try to Classify 'Order' of the animals based on their Numerical Characteristics. The project explores the overall data and tries to find a baseline model for classification.

Zoologists classify animals into different categories like 'Kingdom', 'Phylum', 'Class', 'Order' etc. In the given dataset the Classifications are already done, for sake of learning I will remove the Order of animals of 'Class: Mammalia' and try to predict it using Data Science techniques
